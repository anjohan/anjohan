Postdoc at Sandia National Labs, previously in the group of Boris Kozinsky at Harvard.

I work on molecular dynamics for materials science, with a focus on developing fast-but-accurate machine learning potentials. In particular, I work on profiling, optimization and GPU acceleration.

Highlights:
- FLARE ([mir-group/flare](https://github.com/mir-group/flare)), a fast and Kokkos-accelerated machine learning potential for [extreme-scale simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.12573)
- Phoebe ([mir-group/phoebe](https://github.com/mir-group/phoebe)), a fast and Kokkos-accelerated solver Boltzmann transport code
- Allegro ([mir-group/pair_allegro](https://github.com/mir-group/pair_allegro)), a scalable equivariant neural network potential with state-of-the-art accuracy
